It is built for agents that operate across entire workflows rather than single prompts, making it especially effective for large codebases, complex refactors, and multi-step debugging that unfolds over time. The model shows deeper contextual understanding, stronger problem decomposition, and greater reliability on hard engineering tasks than prior generations.\n\nBeyond coding, Opus 4.6 excels at sustained knowledge work. It produces near-production-ready documents, plans, and analyses in a single pass, and maintains coherence across very long outputs and extended sessions. This makes it a strong default for tasks that require persistence, judgment, and follow-through, such as technical design, migration planning, and end-to-end project execution.\n\nFor users upgrading from earlier Opus versions, see our [official migration guide here](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/guides/model-migrations/claude-4-6-opus)\n",
